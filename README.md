# OTP_Page

This is a demo from my code that I used with some edits because I had to remove some of the utils and other stuff related to the project. I hope it helps.

The view page needs some imports such as material page and other stuff, and because it was connected with other files such as the constants and the style files, you need to put your style in the code and in the text style also.

The final result should look like this:
